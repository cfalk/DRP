"""
A module containing classes to group reactions into sets.

These classses provide  deletion protection to Performed reactions
used in StatsModels. Whilst the DataSet model may, to the uninitiated, appear to be
an erroneous proxy for a many-to-many relationship between Reactions and Models,
This allows the datasets to exist independently of the models.
